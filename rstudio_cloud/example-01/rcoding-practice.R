## Work together in breakout groups to do the following:

# Age is just a number ----

# Create a variable our_ages and assign to it a vector of the ages of your group members (in years)


# Compute the mean of our_ages


# Compute the median of our_ages


# Compute the minimum of our_ages


# Print a string that includes the sum of our_ages
paste("We are", sum(our_ages), "years old.")

# Choose a single group member to enter the sum of our_ages in chat after the breakout rooms close
