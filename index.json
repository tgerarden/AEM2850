That’s fairly short: there are ≈250 words on a typical double-spaced page in Microsoft Word (500 when single-spaced).\nYou can do a lot of different things with this memo: discuss something you learned from the course content, write about the best or worst data visualization you saw recently, connect the course content to your own work, etc. These reflections let you explore and answer some of the key questions of this course.\nThe course content for each week will also include a set of questions specific to that topic. You do not have to answer all (or any) of these questions. They exist to guide your thinking, that’s all.\nA TA will grade reflections using a check system:\n ✔+: (6 points (120%) in gradebook) Reflection shows phenomenal thought and engagement with the course content. We will not assign these often. ✔: (5 points (100%) in gradebook) Reflection is thoughtful, well-written, and shows engagement with the course content. This is the expected level of performance. ✔−: (2.5 points (50%) in gradebook) Reflection is hastily composed, too short, and/or only cursorily engages with the course content. This grade signals that you need to improve next time. We hope not assign these often.  Notice that is essentially a pass/fail or completion-based system. We’re not grading your writing ability; we’re not counting the exact number of words you’re writing; and we’re not looking for encyclopedic citations of every single reading to prove that you did indeed read everything. We are simply looking for thoughtful engagement. Do good work and you’ll get a ✓.\nPlease submit your reflections via canvas. You can choose whether to write them using R Markdown or to use another one of the formats listed in the canvas assignments. I recommend that you use R Markdown to gain more practice with R and RStudio. If you use R Markdown, knit the completed reflection to a PDF document and submit the resulting PDF file via canvas.\nLabs Each week in class we will learn about how to do specific tasks in R. However, without practicing these principles and making graphics on your own, you won’t remember what you learn.\nTo practice, you will complete a brief set of exercises each week. These exercises will have 1–3 short tasks that are directly related to the topic for the week. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. There may also be a final question which requires significantly more thought and work. This will be where you get to show some creativity and stretch your abilities. The labs will also be graded using a similar check system:\n ✔+: (12 points (120%) in gradebook) Exercises are complete. Knitted document is clean and easy to follow. Work is exceptional. We will not assign these often. ✔: (10 points (100%) in gradebook) Exercises are complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. ✔−: (5 points (50%) in gradebook) Exercises are incomplete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. We hope not to assign these often.  As with the Reflections, this is essentially a pass/fail system. We’re not grading your coding ability; we’re not checking each line of code to make sure it produces some exact final figure; and we’re not looking for perfect. Also note that a ✓ does not require 100% success. You will sometimes get stuck with weird errors that you can’t solve, or the demands of pandemic living might occasionally become overwhelming. We are looking for good faith effort. Try hard, do good work, and you’ll get a ✓.\nYou may work together on the labs, but you must turn in your own answers. The default method will be to write these using R Markdown, knit the completed lab to a PDF document, and submit the resulting PDF file via canvas.\nMini projects To give you practice with the data and design principles you’ll learn in this class, you will complete two mini projects. The first will focus on programming, while the second will focus on data visualization. I will provide you with real-world data and pose one or more questions. These will be group projects. More details will be posted later.\nFinal project At the end of the course, you will demonstrate your programming and data visualization skills by completing a final project. This will be a group project. More details will be posted later.\nThere is no final exam. This project is your final exam.\n","date":1646753470,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1646753470,"objectID":"15156c0ce792ef8800e368093ca4a0dc","permalink":"https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/assignment/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignment/","section":"assignment","summary":"You will get the most of out this class if you:\n Engage with the readings and lecture materials Regularly use R  Each type of assignment in this class helps with one of these strategies.","tags":null,"title":"Assignment overview","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Readings Each week we will have a set of readings that you should ideally complete before coming to lecture and working through the examples and labs for each topic.\nGuiding questions Each topic includes a set of questions to help guide your reflection response.

Getting Comfortable with Data Frames As a group: discuss results, answer questions In breakout rooms: 2. Using Functions in Packages    Installing R packages The functionality provided by a fresh install of R is only a small fraction of what is possible. In fact, we refer to what you get after your first install as base R. To access additional functionality, we can use add-ons made by developers. There are currently hundreds of these available from CRAN and many others shared via other repositories such as GitHub. However, because not everybody needs all available functionality, R instead makes different components available via packages. R makes it very easy to install packages from within R. For example, to install the tidyverse package, which we will use throughout the semester, you would just type:\ninstall.packages(\u0026#34;tidyverse\u0026#34;)  In RStudio, you can also do this by navigating to the Tools tab and selecting install packages.\nAfter installation is complete, we can then load the package into our current R session using the library function:\nlibrary(tidyverse)  You only need to install a package once if you are working with a local installation of R. On RStudio Cloud, you may sometimes need to install packages within multiple projects, but I will usually do this for you in advance. After that, you can load it using library whenever you need it. The package remains loaded until we quit the R session (or detach it).\nNote that installing tidyverse actually installs several packages. This commonly occurs when a package has dependencies, or uses functions from other packages. When you load a package using library, you also load its dependencies.\nYou can see all the packages you have installed using the Packages tab in RStudio or via the following function:\ninstalled.packages()  As we move through this course, we will learn more about packages and keep adding them to our toolbox.\n","date":1644264257,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644264257,"objectID":"e47db9ebe831348379e847dbb65e2585","permalink":"https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/example/02-example/","publishdate":"2022-02-07T20:04:17Z","relpermalink":"/example/02-example/","section":"example","summary":"RStudio Cloud links Click here to access this week’s Example RStudio Cloud Project\nSolutions: click here to access a project with a completed version\nPlan for today  Questions? 🙋‍♀️ As a group: briefly skim through basic-base-r-intro.","tags":null,"title":"Basic Base R","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction to Examples Examples contain material we will discuss and use to learn R in class.

It was not created by software engineers for software development. Instead, it was developed by statisticians as an interactive environment for data analysis. This interactivity makes it easy to explore data quickly, which is an indispensable feature for many tasks in business analytics, statistics, data science, and other fields.\nIf you have prior programming experience, you may be surprised by differences between R and other programming languages.\nIf you have no prior programming experience, you may initially be frustrated when learning R. That is normal! Learning to program is essentially learning to speak a new language. But in some ways it’s even more difficult, because your interlocutor is a computer who isn’t always great at telling you when you said something that made no sense.\nRegardless of your prior experience, if you are patient, you will come to appreciate the power of R for data analysis and data visualization.\nR, and the R console As we already discussed, R is the engine that will power our work. One way to control that engine is to use the R console to execute commands as you type them, or to run scripts you have already written. There are several ways to gain access to the R console. One way is to install R on your computer and open the built-in console, which looks like this:\n   However, most people don’t use this console. Instead, they use an integrated development environment (or IDE) to write, debug, and execute their code.\nRStudio The IDE we will use in this class is RStudio. RStudio includes an editor with many R-specific features, a console to execute your code, and other useful panes, including one to show figures or view html documents you produce. RStudio looks like this:\n   RStudio will be our launching pad for data science projects. It not only provides an editor for us to create and edit our scripts but also provides many other useful tools. In this section, we go over some of the basics.\nRStudio panes When you start RStudio for the first time, you will see three panes by default. The left pane shows the R console. On the right, the top pane includes tabs such as Environment and History, while the bottom pane shows five tabs: File, Plots, Packages, Help, and Viewer (these tabs may change in new versions). You can click on each tab to move across the different features.\nTo start a new R script, you can click on File, then New File, then R Script.\nThis starts a new pane on the left and it is here where you can start writing your script.\nKeyboard shortcuts Many tasks we perform with the mouse can be achieved with a combination of key strokes instead, or keyboard shortcuts For example, we just showed how to use the mouse to start a new script, but you can also use a shortcut: Ctrl+⇧+N on Windows and ⌘+⇧+N on macs.\nAlthough using the mouse to explore RStudio’s dropdown menus is a good place to start, I highly recommend that you memorize key bindings for the operations you use most. RStudio provides a useful cheat sheet with the most widely used commands. If you’re on a mac, you can access a list of keyboard by pressing ⌥+⇧+K. You might want to keep this in mind so you can look up keyboard shortcuts when you find yourself doing the same point-and-click operations repeatedly.\nTab completion One advantage of using RStudio is that it has context-aware tab completion. This means that when you start typing the name of a package, function, or object you want to use, RStudio will automatically suggest ways to complete your input. You can take advantage of this by scrolling through the suggestions using up/down arrows and hitting tab to use the selected completion.\nRStudio also does handy things like adding a …","date":1644264226,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644264226,"objectID":"8492f1a04989019e2f783414b45533e3","permalink":"https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/example/01-example/","publishdate":"2022-02-07T20:03:46Z","relpermalink":"/example/01-example/","section":"example","summary":"Introduction to Examples Examples contain material we will discuss and use to learn R in class.

We do not have time to go into the details of these packages in this course, but this project should give you a taste of how R can be used in financial modeling.\nThe primary data for this project are in sp500.RData, which contains two data frames. sp500_companies contains information on the companies in the S\u0026amp;P 500, where each observation corresponds to a company. sp500_prices contains daily price records form 2017-2021 for companies in the S\u0026amp;P 500. Each observation corresponds to a symbol-day. For each observation, there are five prices (open, high, low, close, and adjusted) as well as the trading volume (volume).\nDetails Full instructions are posted in this canvas assignment and in each group’s RStudio Cloud project.\n","date":1646753470,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646753470,"objectID":"258e6033a599b9034dcbfcc82628a58c","permalink":"https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/assignment/01-mini-project/","publishdate":"2022-03-08T15:31:10Z","relpermalink":"/assignment/01-mini-project/","section":"assignment","summary":"Overview In this project, we will use tools from the tidyverse to wrangle and visualize data for firms in the S\u0026P 500.
