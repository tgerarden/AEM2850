Enjoy!","tags":null,"title":"Helpful resources","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"You will get the most of out this class if you:\n Engage with the readings and lecture materials Regularly use R  Each type of assignment in this class helps with one of these strategies.\nReflections To encourage engagement with the course content, you‚Äôll need to write a ‚âà150 word reflection about the readings and lectures for the day. That‚Äôs fairly short: there are ‚âà250 words on a typical double-spaced page in Microsoft Word (500 when single-spaced).\nYou can do a lot of different things with this memo: discuss something you learned from the course content, write about the best or worst data visualization you saw recently, connect the course content to your own work, etc. These reflections let you explore and answer some of the key questions of this course.\nThe course content for each week will also include a set of questions specific to that topic. You do not have to answer all (or any) of these questions. They exist to guide your thinking, that‚Äôs all.\nA TA will grade reflections using a check system:\n ‚úî+: (6 points (120%) in gradebook) Reflection shows phenomenal thought and engagement with the course content. We will not assign these often. ‚úî: (5 points (100%) in gradebook) Reflection is thoughtful, well-written, and shows engagement with the course content. This is the expected level of performance. ‚úî‚àí: (2.5 points (50%) in gradebook) Reflection is hastily composed, too short, and/or only cursorily engages with the course content. This grade signals that you need to improve next time. We hope not assign these often.  Notice that is essentially a pass/fail or completion-based system. We‚Äôre not grading your writing ability; we‚Äôre not counting the exact number of words you‚Äôre writing; and we‚Äôre not looking for encyclopedic citations of every single reading to prove that you did indeed read everything. We are simply looking for thoughtful engagement. Do good work and you‚Äôll get a ‚úì.\nPlease submit your reflections via canvas. You can choose whether to write them using R Markdown or to use another one of the formats listed in the canvas assignments. I recommend that you use R Markdown to gain more practice with R and RStudio. If you use R Markdown, knit the completed reflection to a PDF document and submit the resulting PDF file via canvas.\nLabs Each week in class we will learn about how to do specific tasks in R. However, without practicing these principles and making graphics on your own, you won‚Äôt remember what you learn.\nTo practice, you will complete a brief set of exercises each week. These exercises will have 1‚Äì3 short tasks that are directly related to the topic for the week. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. There may also be a final question which requires significantly more thought and work. This will be where you get to show some creativity and stretch your abilities. The labs will also be graded using a similar check system:\n ‚úî+: (12 points (120%) in gradebook) Exercises are complete. Knitted document is clean and easy to follow. Work is exceptional. We will not assign these often. ‚úî: (10 points (100%) in gradebook) Exercises are complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. ‚úî‚àí: (5 points (50%) in gradebook) Exercises are incomplete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. We hope not to assign these often.  As with the Reflections, this is essentially a pass/fail system. We‚Äôre not grading your coding ability; we‚Äôre not checking each line of code to make sure it produces some exact final figure; and we‚Äôre not looking for perfect. Also note that a ‚úì does not require 100% success. You will sometimes get stuck with weird errors that you can‚Äôt solve, or the demands of pandemic living might occasionally become overwhelming. We are looking for good faith effort. Try hard, do good work, and you‚Äôll get a ‚úì.\nYou may work together on the labs, but you must turn in your own answers. The default method will be to write these using R Markdown, knit the completed lab to a PDF document, and submit the resulting PDF file via canvas.\nMini projects To give you practice with the data and design principles you‚Äôll learn in this class, you will complete two mini projects. The first will focus on programming, while the second will focus on data visualization. I will provide you with real-world data and pose one or more questions. These will be group projects. More details will be posted later.\nFinal project At the end of the course, you will demonstrate your programming and data visualization skills by completing a final project. This will be a group project. More details will be posted later.\nThere is no final exam. This project is your final exam.\n","date":1652132562,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1652132562,"objectID":"15156c0ce792ef8800e368093ca4a0dc","permalink":"https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/assignment/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignment/","section":"assignment","summary":"You will get the most of out this class if you:\n Engage with the readings and lecture materials Regularly use R  Each type of assignment in this class helps with one of these strategies.","tags":null,"title":"Assignment overview","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Readings Each week we will have a set of readings that you should ideally complete before coming to lecture and working through the examples and labs for each topic.\nGuiding questions Each topic includes a set of questions to help guide your reflection response.

Getting Comfortable with Data Frames As a group: discuss results, answer questions In breakout rooms: 2. Using Functions in Packages    Installing R packages The functionality provided by a fresh install of R is only a small fraction of what is possible. In fact, we refer to what you get after your first install as base R. To access additional functionality, we can use add-ons made by developers. There are currently hundreds of these available from CRAN and many others shared via other repositories such as GitHub. However, because not everybody needs all available functionality, R instead makes different components available via packages. R makes it very easy to install packages from within R. For example, to install the tidyverse package, which we will use throughout the semester, you would just type:\ninstall.packages(\u0026#34;tidyverse\u0026#34;)  In RStudio, you can also do this by navigating to the Tools tab and selecting install packages.\nAfter installation is complete, we can then load the package into our current R session using the library function:\nlibrary(tidyverse)  You only need to install a package once if you are working with a local installation of R. On RStudio Cloud, you may sometimes need to install packages within multiple projects, but I will usually do this for you in advance. After that, you can load it using library whenever you need it. The package remains loaded until we quit the R session (or detach it).\nNote that installing tidyverse actually installs several packages. This commonly occurs when a package has dependencies, or uses functions from other packages. When you load a package using library, you also load its dependencies.\nYou can see all the packages you have installed using the Packages tab in RStudio or via the following function:\ninstalled.packages()  As we move through this course, we will learn more about packages and keep adding them to our toolbox.\n","date":1644264257,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644264257,"objectID":"e47db9ebe831348379e847dbb65e2585","permalink":"https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/example/02-example/","publishdate":"2022-02-07T20:04:17Z","relpermalink":"/example/02-example/","section":"example","summary":"RStudio Cloud links Click here to access this week‚Äôs Example RStudio Cloud Project\nSolutions: click here to access a project with a completed version\nPlan for today  Questions? üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è As a group: briefly skim through basic-base-r-intro.","tags":null,"title":"Basic Base R","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction to Examples Examples contain material we will discuss and use to learn R in class.

It was not created by software engineers for software development. Instead, it was developed by statisticians as an interactive environment for data analysis. This interactivity makes it easy to explore data quickly, which is an indispensable feature for many tasks in business analytics, statistics, data science, and other fields.\nIf you have prior programming experience, you may be surprised by differences between R and other programming languages.\nIf you have no prior programming experience, you may initially be frustrated when learning R. That is normal! Learning to program is essentially learning to speak a new language. But in some ways it‚Äôs even more difficult, because your interlocutor is a computer who isn‚Äôt always great at telling you when you said something that made no sense.\nRegardless of your prior experience, if you are patient, you will come to appreciate the power of R for data analysis and data visualization.\nR, and the R console As we already discussed, R is the engine that will power our work. One way to control that engine is to use the R console to execute commands as you type them, or to run scripts you have already written. There are several ways to gain access to the R console. One way is to install R on your computer and open the built-in console, which looks like this:\n   However, most people don‚Äôt use this console. Instead, they use an integrated development environment (or IDE) to write, debug, and execute their code.\nRStudio The IDE we will use in this class is RStudio. RStudio includes an editor with many R-specific features, a console to execute your code, and other useful panes, including one to show figures or view html documents you produce. RStudio looks like this:\n   RStudio will be our launching pad for data science projects. It not only provides an editor for us to create and edit our scripts but also provides many other useful tools. In this section, we go over some of the basics.\nRStudio panes When you start RStudio for the first time, you will see three panes by default. The left pane shows the R console. On the right, the top pane includes tabs such as Environment and History, while the bottom pane shows five tabs: File, Plots, Packages, Help, and Viewer (these tabs may change in new versions). You can click on each tab to move across the different features.\nTo start a new R script, you can click on File, then New File, then R Script.\nThis starts a new pane on the left and it is here where you can start writing your script.\nKeyboard shortcuts Many tasks we perform with the mouse can be achieved with a combination of key strokes instead, or keyboard shortcuts For example, we just showed how to use the mouse to start a new script, but you can also use a shortcut: Ctrl+‚áß+N on Windows and ‚åò+‚áß+N on macs.\nAlthough using the mouse to explore RStudio‚Äôs dropdown menus is a good place to start, I highly recommend that you memorize key bindings for the operations you use most. RStudio provides a useful cheat sheet with the most widely used commands. If you‚Äôre on a mac, you can access a list of keyboard by pressing ‚å•+‚áß+K. You might want to keep this in mind so you can look up keyboard shortcuts when you find yourself doing the same point-and-click operations repeatedly.\nTab completion One advantage of using RStudio is that it has context-aware tab completion. This means that when you start typing the name of a package, function, or object you want to use, RStudio will automatically suggest ways to complete your input. You can take advantage of this by scrolling through the suggestions using up/down arrows and hitting tab to use the selected completion.\nRStudio also does handy things like adding a ‚Ä¶","date":1644264226,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644264226,"objectID":"8492f1a04989019e2f783414b45533e3","permalink":"https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/example/01-example/","publishdate":"2022-02-07T20:03:46Z","relpermalink":"/example/01-example/","section":"example","summary":"Introduction to Examples Examples contain material we will discuss and use to learn R in class.

You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard‚ÄîR handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\nRStudio.cloud R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, this course uses RStudio.cloud, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won‚Äôt have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for labs and problem sets.\nGo to https://rstudio.cloud/ and create an account. You‚Äôll receive a link to join the shared class workspace separately. If you don‚Äôt get this link, let me know and I will invite you.\nRStudio on your computer RStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you might want to wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud and install all these things locally. This will also be handy in the future if you want to use R for other classes, jobs, etc.\nHere are some links to get set up for this class:\nInstall R First you need to install R itself (the engine).\n  Go to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)1 website: https://cran.r-project.org/\n  Click on ‚ÄúDownload R for XXX‚Äù, where XXX is your operating system:\n  If you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (in this picture, it‚Äôs R-4.1.2.pkg) and download it.\n  If you use Windows, click ‚Äúbase‚Äù (or click on the bolded ‚Äúinstall R for the first time‚Äù link) and download it.\n    Double click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n  If you use macOS, download and install XQuartz.2 You do not need to do this on Windows.\n  Install RStudio Next, you need to install RStudio (the dashboard). Once both R and RStudio are installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won‚Äôt have to interact with R directly.\n  Go to the free download location on RStudio‚Äôs website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\n  The website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it. For example:\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n  Double click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n  Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\nInstall tidyverse R packages are easy to install with RStudio. There are multiple ways to do it. Here are two ways to install the tidyverse and all its dependencies from CRAN:\n Within RStudio, enter install.packages(\u0026#34;tidyverse\u0026#34;) in the R console.  Select the packages panel, click on ‚ÄúInstall,‚Äù type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.  You‚Äôll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages and dependencies are installed. If you choose option 2, you might notice that RStudio implements your selection by generating the line of code install.packages(\u0026#34;tidyverse\u0026#34;) and entering it in the console.\nYou can use either of these methods to install additional packages for your work. Packages just need to be installed once per device (and then loaded each time you want to use them).\nInstall rmarkdown Follow your preferred procedure from above to install rmarkdown.\nInstall tinytex Note: If you already have a LaTeX distribution installed on your device, you can skip this step.\nWhen you knit to PDF, R uses a special scientific typesetting program named LaTeX (pronounced ‚Äúlay-tek‚Äù; for goofy nerdy reasons, the x is technically the ‚Äúch‚Äù sound in ‚ÄúBach‚Äù, but most people just say it as ‚Äúk‚Äù).\nLaTeX is neat and makes pretty documents, but it‚Äôs a huge program‚Äîthe macOS version, for instance, is over 4 GB! To make life easier, there‚Äôs an R package named TinyTeX that installs a minimal LaTeX program and that automatically deals with differences between macOS and Windows.\nHere‚Äôs how to install tinytex so you can knit to pretty PDFs:\n Use the Packages in panel in RStudio to install tinytex like you did above with tidyverse. Alternatively, run install.packages(\u0026#34;tinytex\u0026#34;) in the console. Run tinytex::install_tinytex() in the console. Wait for a bit while R downloads and installs everything you need. The end! You should now be able to knit to PDF.  Reminder: come to office hours if you need help with this!

All of these things will do exactly the same thing:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026#34;compact\u0026#34;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026#34;compact\u0026#34;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026#34;compact\u0026#34;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty\u0026gt;10, class==\u0026#34;compact\u0026#34;) filter(mpg,cty\u0026gt;10,class==\u0026#34;compact\u0026#34;) mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026#34;compact\u0026#34;) filter ( mpg,cty\u0026gt;10, class==\u0026#34;compact\u0026#34; )  But you‚Äôll notice that only a few of those iterations (the first three) are easily readable.\nTo help improve readability and make it easier to share code with others, there‚Äôs an unofficial style guide for writing R code. It‚Äôs fairly short and just has lots of examples of good and bad ways of writing code (naming variables, dealing with long lines, using proper indentation levels, etc.)‚Äîyou should glance through it some time.\nRStudio has a built-in way of cleaning up your code. Select some code, press ctrl + i (on Windows) or ‚åò + i (on macOS), and R will reformat the code for you. It‚Äôs not always perfect, but it‚Äôs really helpful for getting indentation right without having to manually hit space a billion times.\nMain style things to pay attention to for this class  Note: We won‚Äôt grade you on this! If you submit something like filter(mpg,cty\u0026gt;10,class==\u0026#34;compact\u0026#34;), we might recommend adding spaces, but we won‚Äôt take points off.\n Spacing  See the ‚ÄúSpacing‚Äù section in the tidyverse style guide.\n Put spaces after commas (like in regular English):\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter(mpg,cty \u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg ,cty \u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg , cty \u0026gt; 10)  Put spaces around operators like +, -, \u0026gt;, =, etc.:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter(mpg, cty\u0026gt;10) filter(mpg, cty\u0026gt; 10) filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt;10)  Don‚Äôt put spaces around parentheses that are parts of functions:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) # Bad filter (mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) filter ( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10) filter( mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10 )  Long lines  See the ‚ÄúLong lines‚Äù section in the tidyverse style guide.\n It‚Äôs good practice to make sure your lines of code don‚Äôt get too long. A good suggestion is to keep lines at a maximum of 80 characters. Instead of counting characters by hand (ü•¥), in RStudio go to ‚ÄúTools‚Äù \u0026gt; ‚ÄúGlobal Options‚Äù \u0026gt; ‚ÄúCode‚Äù \u0026gt; ‚ÄúDisplay‚Äù and check the box for ‚ÄúShow margin.‚Äù You should now see a really thin line indicating 80 characters. Again, you can go beyond this‚Äîthat‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs just good practice to avoid going too far past it.\nYou can add line breaks inside longer lines of code. Line breaks should come after commas, and things like function arguments should align within the function:\n# Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026#34;compact\u0026#34;) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026#34;compact\u0026#34;) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class == \u0026#34;compact\u0026#34;) # Bad filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026#34;compact\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pickup\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;midsize\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;subcompact\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;suv\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;2seater\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;minivan\u0026#34;)) # Good filter(mpg, cty \u0026gt; 10, class %in% c(\u0026#34;compact\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pickup\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;midsize\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;subcompact\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;suv\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;2seater\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;minivan\u0026#34;))  Pipes (%\u0026gt;%) and ggplot layers (+) Put each step in a dplyr pipeline on separate lines, with the %\u0026gt;% at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Bad mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Super bad mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work mpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy))  Put each layer of a ggplot plot on separate lines, with the + at the end of the line, indented with two spaces:\n# Good ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Bad ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Super bad ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() # Super bad and won\u0026#39;t even work ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw()  Comments  See the ‚ÄúComments‚Äù section in the tidyverse style guide.\n Comments should start with a comment symbol and a single space: # \n# Good #Bad #Bad  If the comment is really short (and won‚Äôt cause you to go over 80 characters in the line), you can include it in the same line as the code:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 + group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group  You can add extra spaces to get inline comments to align, if you want:\nmpg %\u0026gt;% filter(cty \u0026gt; 10) %\u0026gt;% # Only rows where cty is 10 + group_by(class) %\u0026gt;% # Divide into class groups summarize(avg_hwy = mean(hwy)) # Find the average hwy in each group  If the comment is really long, you can break it into multiple lines.

Another is to use a package like tidyquant to tq_get() quantative data in a tibble format. This package can also be used to get data from FRED, Quandl, and other sources.    Twitter: You could collect data on tweets that reference a specific company via the twitter API or by using a package like twitteR to access the API. Then you could use this on its own or in conjunction with some other data (e.g., stock prices/returns) to do an analysis of consumer sentiment, for example.\n  Inside Airbnb: Inside Airbnb is a mission-driven activist project with the objective to provide data that quantifies the impact of short-term rentals on housing and residential communities, as well as create a platform to support advocacy for policies to protect our cities from the impacts of short-term rentals.

Way to go!\nNow you get to show off all the tools you learned with an insightful and informative analysis of your own construction. For your final project, you will take a dataset, explore it, tinker with it, and use it to tell a nuanced story or produce a useful product.\nI want this project to be as useful for you and your future career as possible, so you get to choose what data you use (within reason). I‚Äôve linked to some suggested business datasets below, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to look for other datasets that you are interested in.\nSummary of key steps and timeline Step 1. Choose a group by Friday, April 29 Create groups of 3 and submit the list of group members on canvas.\nStep 2. Choose data and make a plan by Thursday, May 5 Find some interesting data to work with! Ideally this would be related to business. Here is a list of suggested data sources. Any data we have used in the class is also fair game, though you would need to do something new and different with it.\nOr you might want to start by sketching out a project idea and then thinking through how to get the necessary data. See below for a list of example project ideas.\nEither way you approach it, you need to figure out both your data and plan at this stage and then submit a few sentences describing them on canvas.\nNote: You are expected to use programming and data visualization skills we have developed throughout class. In addition, you are required to use at least one of the following special topics we covered in the last part of the semester:\n space text functions prediction methods web scraping  Step 3. Execute your plan Teamwork makes the dream work.\nStep 4. Submit your final project by Thursday, May 19 at 4:30pm Upload the following files to canvas once for each group:\n Your memo in PDF format (see full instructions below). A .zip file of your project directory that is self-contained: the .Rmd source file, .RProj, data files, etc. I should be able to open your project and knit your document with one click.  No late work will be accepted for this project since the final project counts as your final and the deadline is set by the university.\nWe will use this rubric to grade the final product.\nInstructions Use R to:\n  Download a dataset and explore it using all the tools and tricks we learned in lectures, examples, and labs throughout the semester.\n  Find a story in the data. This could include patterns in the data like relationships and changes over time that could be visualized. Relationships could also be summarized using linear regression. You could build a prediction mdoel using OLS, ridge, or lasso. Alternatively, you could focus on analysis and visualization of spatial or textual data.\n  Create multiple graphs to tell the story. You must use at least three different chart types (i.e., don‚Äôt just make three scatterplots or three maps).\n  Write a PDF memo using R Markdown to introduce your project, provide background on your data and the data cleaning process, and describe your figure and findings. You should include the following sections in the memo:\n Executive summary Data description Data cleaning description Analysis description Findings    Do not include your source code in the memo unless you think it is crucial for communicating your methods or findings. Write the memo with a non-technical supervisor in mind‚Äîsomeone who will be more interested in your approach and findings than the code you wrote. But don‚Äôt forget the importance of clearly communicating key steps when the source code is not included in the primary deliverable!\nFollow R Markdown etiquette rules and style that we introduced throughout the semester in labs‚Äîdon‚Äôt output extraneous messages or warnings, use nice formatting for tables, and adjust the dimensions for your figures as needed.\nYou might want to customize your memo, for example by including section headings and a table of contents for clarity. This site provides a summary of some basic options for PDF documents you may find helpful.\nGrading rubric We will use this rubric to grade the final product.\nReminders   Don‚Äôt forget to utilize your teaching staff! You can email us or set up appointments to get help. Prof. Gerarden has posted extra office hours by appointment at aem2850.youcanbook.me.\n  Part of your individual grade will be based on your contribution to the group. I will conduct an anonymous peer-review survey to help assess each person‚Äôs contribution.\n  You will be graded on both the content and its presentation. Follow best practices from class and readings when making visuals. Make each graphic clear and comprehensible (even on its own). When writing text to summarize your work and discuss takeaways, please be concise.\nTo drive home the importance of presentation, here are some lessons learned from making COVID data dashboards (source):\n Among the shared themes for the dashboards were simplicity and clarity.
