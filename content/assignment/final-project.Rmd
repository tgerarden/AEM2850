You've made it to the end of our whirlwind intro to R programming! Way to go!

Now you get to show off all the tools you learned with an insightful and informative analysis of your own construction. For your final project, you will take a dataset, explore it, tinker with it, and use it to tell a nuanced story or produce a useful product.

I want this project to be as useful for you and your future career as possible, so you get to choose what data you use (within reason). I've linked to some suggested business datasets below, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to look for other datasets that you are interested in.


## Summary of key steps and timeline

### Step 1. Choose a group by Friday, April 29

Create groups of 3 and submit the list of group members on canvas.

### Step 2. Choose data and make a plan by Thursday, May 5

Find some interesting data to work with! Ideally this would be related to business. [Here is a list of suggested data sources](/resource/data/). Any data we have used in the class is also fair game, though you would need to do something new and different with it.

Or you might want to start by sketching out a project idea and then thinking through how to get the necessary data. [See below for a list of example project ideas](#examples).

Either way you approach it, you need to figure out both your data and plan at this stage and then submit a few sentences describing them on canvas.

**Note:** You are expected to use programming and data visualization skills we have developed throughout class. In addition, **you are required to use at least one of the following special topics we covered in the last part of the semester**:

- space
- text
- functions
- prediction methods
- web scraping

### Step 3. Execute your plan

Teamwork makes the dream work.

### Step 4. Submit your final project by Thursday, May 19 at 4:30pm

One submission per group.


## Example project ideas {#examples}

We do not have any examples from past years sine this class is brand new. Here is a list of off-the-cuff project ideas to give you a sense of the scope of the project and range of possibilities. You are welcome to use one of these, but that is not expected or required.

- Write a program to automate an investment plan. For example, you could write functions to take a set of stock tickers and derive portfolio weights for each ticker based on some (sensible) investment strategy. This could be done using a fixed time period of historical data or a user-specified time window.
- Use functions to compute business analytics metrics for different companies and/or time periods. For example you could use data from SEC filings to summarize the evolution of companies' fundamentals over time.
- Use twitter data to study the relationship between a company's twitter activity (e.g., tweets, mentions, etc.) and some performance metric (e.g., excess daily returns in the stock market).
- Construct a prediction model for future stock (or index) price movements based on past movements.
- Develop a pricing strategy you would use if you were in charge of a specific product, and provide a sophisticated and compelling rationale for your strategy that is grounded in data.


## Instructions

More detailed instructions will be posted here soon!

<!-- Here's what you'll need to do: -->

<!-- 1. **Download** a dataset and explore it using all the tools and tricks we learned in lectures, examples, and labs throughout the semester -->

<!-- 2. **Find** a story in the data. This could include patterns in the data like relationships and changes over time that could be visualized. Relationships could also be summarized using linear regression. You could build a prediction mdoel using OLS, ridge, or lasso. Alternatively, you could focus on analysis and visualization of spatial or textual data.-->

<!-- 3. Use R to **create** multiple graphs to tell the story. You can make as many graphs as you want, but you must use at least **three** different chart types (i.e. don't just make three scatterplots or three maps).  -->

<!-- 4. Export these figures as PDF files, place them in Adobe Illustrator (or InDesign or Gravit Designer or Inkscape), and **make** one combined graphic or handout where you tell the complete story. You have a lot of latitude in how you do this. You can make a graphic-heavy one-page handout. You can make something along the lines of the [this](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/nuclear-power-reactors-global), with one big graphic + smaller subgraphics + explanatory text. Just don't make a [goofy infographic](https://medium.com/@kazarnowicz/why-infographics-are-bad-3a2fa49673e2). Whatever you do, the final figure must include all the graphics, must have some explanatory text to help summarize the narrative, and must be well designed. -->

<!-- 5. **Write** a memo using R Markdown to introduce, frame, and describe your story and figure. [Use this template to get started](/files/your_name_finalproject.Rmd). You should include the following in the memo: -->

<!--     - Executive summary -->
<!--     - Background information and summary of the data -->
<!--     - Explanation, description, and code for each individual figure -->
<!--     - Explanation and description for the final figure -->
<!--     - Final figure should be included as an image (remember `![Caption goes here](path/to/file.png)`) -->

<!-- Remember to follow R Markdown etiquette rules and style—don't have it output extraneous messages or warnings, include summary tables in nice tables, adjust the dimensions for your figures, and remove the placeholder text that's in the template already (i.e. I don't want to see stuff like "Describe and show how you cleaned and reshaped the data" in the final report.) -->

<!-- **You should [download a full example of what a final project might look like](/projects/example_final.zip)** (but don't make your final combined visualization look exactly like this—show some creativity!) -->


<!-- ## Final deliverables -->

<!-- Upload the following files to canvas: -->

<!-- 1. A memo introducing and describing your final graphic (see full instructions above) -->
<!-- 2. Source code... -->

<!-- **No late work will be accepted for this project since it's the last project and it counts as your final.** -->

<!-- I will use [this rubric](/files/final-project-rubric.xlsx) to grade the final product: -->

<!-- - [<i class="fas fa-file-excel"></i> `final-project-rubric.xlsx`](/files/final-project-rubric.xlsx) -->

<!-- I am happy to give feedback and help along the way—please don't hesitate to get help! My goal is for you to have a beautiful graphic in the end that you'll want to show off to all your friends, family, neighbors, employers, and strangers on the street—I'm not trying to trip you up or give you trick questions! -->



<!-- ## Expectations -->

<!-- Details to come soon. -->

<!-- Here I will add some stuff about how presentation matters, etc. etc. -->

<!-- Build off guidance and also grading of mini project 1 -->

<!-- Presentation matters! -->

<!-- Here is an example of the lessons learned from making COVID data dashboards: -->

<!-- [](https://flowingdata.com/2022/04/06/lessons-learned-from-making-covid-dashboards/) -->

<!-- > Among the shared themes for the dashboards were simplicity and clarity. Whether you are producing visuals and analytical tools for policymakers or for the public, Blauer says, the same rules of thumb apply. “Don’t overcomplicate your visualization, make the conclusions as clear as possible, and speak in the most basic of plain-language terms,” she says. -->

<!-- > Yet, as other data scientists point out, presenting data simply might not be enough to ensure viewers get the message. For one thing, attention to detail matters. Ritchie recalls how she and her team spent hours focused on the titles and subtitles of charts, “because that is ultimately what most people will look at”. And in those titles and subtitles, the analysts made sure to specify ‘confirmed’ deaths or ‘confirmed’ cases. “An emphasis on ‘confirmed’ is really important because we know that it’s an underestimate of the total,” says Ritchie. “It might seem very basic, but it’s really crucial to how you understand the data and the scale of the pandemic.” -->
