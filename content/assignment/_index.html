<p>You will get the most of out this class if you:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Engage with the readings and lecture materials</li>
<li>Regularly use R</li>
</ol>
<p>Each type of assignment in this class helps with one of these strategies.</p>
<div id="reflections" class="section level3">
<h3>Reflections</h3>
<p>To encourage engagement with the course content, you’ll need to write a ≈150 word reflection about the readings and lectures for the day. That’s fairly short: there are ≈250 words on a typical double-spaced page in Microsoft Word (500 when single-spaced).</p>
<p>You can do a lot of different things with this memo: discuss something you learned from the course content, write about the best or worst data visualization you saw recently, connect the course content to your own work, etc. These reflections let you explore and answer some of the key questions of this course.</p>
<!-- - What is truth? How is truth related to visualization? -->
<!-- - Why do we visualize data? -->
<!-- - What makes a great visualization? What makes a bad visualization? -->
<!-- - How do you choose which kind of visualization to use? -->
<!-- - What is the role of stories in presenting analysis? -->
<p>The course content for each day will also include a set of questions specific to that topic. <em>You do not have to answer all (or any) of these questions</em>. They exist to guide your thinking, that’s all.</p>
<p>The TA will grade these memos using a check system:</p>
<ul>
<li>✔+: (<em>6 points (120%) in gradebook</em>) Reflection shows phenomenal thought and engagement with the course content. We will not assign these often.</li>
<li>✔: (<em>5 points (100%) in gradebook</em>) Reflection is thoughtful, well-written, and shows engagement with the course content. This is the expected level of performance.</li>
<li>✔−: (<em>2.5 points (50%) in gradebook</em>) Reflection is hastily composed, too short, and/or only cursorily engages with the course content. This grade signals that you need to improve next time. We hope not assign these often.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that is essentially a pass/fail or completion-based system. We’re not grading your writing ability; we’re not counting the exact number of words you’re writing; and we’re not looking for encyclopedic citations of every single reading to prove that you did indeed read everything. We are simply looking for thoughtful engagement. Do good work and you’ll get a ✓.</p>
<p>You will write these using <code>R Markdown</code>, <code>knit</code> the completed reflection to a html document, and submit the resulting html file via canvas (unless instructed otherwise).</p>
</div>
<div id="labs" class="section level3">
<h3>Labs</h3>
<p>Each week in class we will learn about how to do specific tasks in R. However, without practicing these principles and making graphics on your own, you won’t remember what you learn.</p>
<p>To practice, you will complete a brief set of exercises each week. These exercises will have 1–3 short tasks that are directly related to the topic for the week. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. There may also be a final question which requires significantly more thought and work. This will be where you get to show some creativity and stretch your abilities. The labs will also be graded using a similar check system:</p>
<ul>
<li>✔+: (<em>12 points (120%) in gradebook</em>) Exercises are complete. Knitted document is clean and easy to follow. Work is exceptional. We will not assign these often.</li>
<li>✔: (<em>10 points (100%) in gradebook</em>) Exercises are complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance.</li>
<li>✔−: (<em>5 points (50%) in gradebook</em>) Exercises are incomplete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. We hope not to assign these often.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with the Reflections, this is essentially a pass/fail system. We’re not grading your coding ability; we’re not checking each line of code to make sure it produces some exact final figure; and we’re not looking for perfect. Also note that a ✓ does not require 100% success. You will sometimes get stuck with weird errors that you can’t solve, or the demands of pandemic living might occasionally become overwhelming. We are looking for good faith effort. Try hard, do good work, and you’ll get a ✓.</p>
<p>You may work together on the labs, but you must turn in your own answers. The default method will be to write these using <code>R Markdown</code>, <code>knit</code> the completed lab to a PDF document, and submit the resulting PDF file via canvas.</p>

<div id="mini-projects" class="section level3">
<h3>Mini projects</h3>
<p>To give you practice with the data and design principles you’ll learn in this class, you will complete two mini projects. The first will focus on programming, while the second will focus on data visualization. I will provide you with real-world data and pose one or more questions. <strong>These will be group projects.</strong> More details will be posted later.</p>
<!-- The mini projects will be graded using a check system: -->
<!-- - ✔+: (*85 points (≈115%) in gradebook*) Project is phenomenally well-designed and uses advanced R techniques. The project uncovers an important story that is not readily apparent from just looking at the raw data. I will not assign these often. -->
<!-- - ✔: (*75 points (100%) in gradebook*) Project is fine, follows most design principles, answers a question from the data, and uses R correctly. This is the expected level of performance. -->
<!-- - ✔−: (*37.5 points (50%) in gradebook*) Project is missing large components, is poorly designed, does not answer a relevant question, and/or uses R incorrectly. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often. -->
<!-- Because these mini projects give you practice for the final project, I will provide you with substantial feedback on your design and code. -->
</div>
<div id="final-project" class="section level3">
<h3>Final project</h3>
<p>At the end of the course, you will demonstrate your programming and data visualization skills by completing a final project. <strong>This will be a group project.</strong> More details will be posted later.</p>
<!-- [Complete details for the final project (including past examples of excellent projects) are here.](/assignment/final-project/) -->
<p><strong>There is no final exam. This project is your final exam.</strong></p>
<!-- The project will ***not*** be graded using a check system. Instead I will use a rubric to grade four elements of your project: -->
<!-- 1. Technical skills -->
<!-- 2. Visual design -->
<!-- 3. Truth and beauty -->
<!-- 4. Story -->
<!-- If you've engaged with the course content and completed the exercises and mini projects throughout the course, you should do just fine with the final project. -->
