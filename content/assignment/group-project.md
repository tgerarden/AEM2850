# Overview

In this project, we will use tools from the tidyverse to wrangle and visualize data for firms in the S&P 500. In practice, if you were to use R for investment research in industry, you would want to use additional packages that provide specialized functions to process and visualize financial data. We do not have time to go into the details of these packages in this course, but this project should give you a taste of how R can be used in financial modeling.
