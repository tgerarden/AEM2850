## Lab 1

This week's lab is a short survey to help us get to know you: <https://forms.gle/42MmZxJ9PqEBywhQ9>.

As with other labs throughout the semester, it is due Monday at 11:59pm (of the week following when we cover the material). The first lab should only take a few minutes and does not require any programming.
