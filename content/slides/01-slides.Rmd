# Why R for Life?

Practical tool that could help you get a job and then do said job

--

Open source

--

Huge community of users and package developers

--

Here are a few examples of other things you can do using R:
- Make slides like the ones you're looking at right now
- Build websites like [our course site](https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com)
- Write books like [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)
- Make interactive web apps
- Much, much more

# Plan for each week

We will follow the same general process each week:

- Do readings listed on the before Tuesday ([example: Week 1](https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/content/01-content/))
- **Tuesday:** come to class, where I will summarize material for that week's topic
- **Wednesday:** submit reflection on canvas by 11:59pm (starting with Week 2)
- **Thursday:** come to class, where we will work through hands-on examples
- Work on the lab before the next Tuesday’s class, attending office hours as needed
- **The following Monday:** submit lab on canvas by 11:59pm (starting with Week 1)

---

# Assignments

We will have frequent, short assignments to develop and cement new skills.

No prelims, no final exam.

.pull-left[
- **Reflections** are short weekly writing assignments, intended as an easy way to get points and a nudge to engage with readings

- **Labs** are short weekly homework assignments that require you to practice programming

- **Projects** are intended to synthesize and reinforce individual skills, and to provide examples of their application to business and life more generally

# Sucking

> "The bad news is whenever you’re learning a new tool, for a long time you’re going to suck. It's going to be very frustrating.
> 
> But, the good news is that that is typical, it’s something that happens to everyone, and it’s only temporary.
> 
> Unfortunately, there is no way to go from knowing nothing about a subject to knowing something about a subject and being an expert in it without going through a period of great frustration and much suckiness.
> 
> But remember, when you're getting frustrated, that's a good thing, that's temporary, keep pushing through, and in time [it] will become second nature."

Alberto Cairo, *The Truthful Art*:

> 1. It is truthful, as it’s based on thorough and honest research.
> 
> 2. It is functional, as it constitutes an accurate depiction of the data, and it’s built in a way that lets people do meaningful operations based on it (seeing change in time).
> 
> 3. It is beautiful, in the sense of being attractive, intriguing, and even aesthetically pleasing for its intended audience—scientists, in the first place, but the general public, too.
> 
> 4. It is insightful, as it reveals evidence that we would have a hard time seeing otherwise.
> 
> 5. It is enlightening because if we grasp and accept the evidence it depicts, it will change our minds for the better.

# What makes a great visualization?

.box-inv-6["Graphical excellence is the **well-designed presentation of interesting data**—a matter of substance, of statistics, and of design … [It] consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency. … [It] is that which **gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space** … [It] is nearly always multivariate … And graphical excellence requires **telling the truth about the data**."]
