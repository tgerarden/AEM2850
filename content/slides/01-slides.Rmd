# Plan for each week

We will follow the same general process each week:

- Do readings listed on the course site before Tuesday ([example: Week 1](https://aem2850.toddgerarden.com/content/01-content/))

- **Tuesday:** come to class, where we will discuss material for that week's topic

- **Thursday:** come to class, where we will work through hands-on examples

- Work on the lab before the next Tuesday’s class, attending office hours as needed

- **The following Monday:** submit lab on canvas by 11:59pm (starting with Week 1)

---

# Assignments

.pull-left[
<!-- - **Reflections** are short weekly writing assignments, intended as an easy way to get points and a nudge to engage with readings -->

- **Labs** are short weekly homework assignments that require you to practice programming

- **Prelims** are intended to assess programming and data visualization proficiency

- The **group project** is intended to synthesize and reinforce skills in real-world applications

- **Class participation** is the best way to learn the material, attendance is expected

# Sucking

> "The bad news is whenever you’re learning a new tool, for a long time you’re going to suck. It's going to be very frustrating.
> 
> But, the good news is that that is typical, it’s something that happens to everyone, and it’s only temporary.
> 
> Unfortunately, there is no way to go from knowing nothing about a subject to knowing something about a subject and being an expert in it without going through a period of great frustration and much suckiness.
> 
> But remember, when you're getting frustrated, that's a good thing, that's temporary, keep pushing through, and in time [it] will become second nature."

# How does 2023 compare to 2022 so far?

One way to do this in R. First, we'll need to import and prep the data:

```{r ithaca-weather-data}
library(tidyverse); library(lubridate)

# identify the Cornell station
stations <- read_csv("data/01-slides/ny-stations.csv")
cornell <- stations |>
  filter(str_detect(NAME, "CORNELL"))
  
# read in and bind relevant data
clean_data <- function(y, s, m) {
  str_glue("data/01-slides/ny-weather-", y, ".csv") |>
    read_csv() |>
    inner_join(s, by = "STATION") |>
    mutate(mon = month(DATE),
           day = day(DATE),
           year = year(DATE)) |>
    filter(mon == m)
}
years <- c(2022, 2023)
cornell_temps <- map(years, clean_data, cornell, 1) |>
  bind_rows()
```

---

# How does 2023 compare to 2022 so far?

.pull-left[
```{r ithaca-weather-plot1, fig.show="hide", fig.dim=c(4, 3), out.width="100%"}
# plot data
cornell_temps |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = day, 
             y = TMAX)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw()
```

What's wrong with this plot?
]

.pull-right[
  ![](`r knitr::fig_chunk("ithaca-weather-plot1", "png")`)
]

---

# How does 2023 compare to 2022 so far?

.pull-left[
```{r ithaca-weather-plot2, fig.show="hide", fig.dim=c(4, 3), out.width="100%"}
# plot data

  ggplot(aes(x = day, 
             y = TMAX, 
             color = as_factor(year))) + #<<
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") #<<
```

What's wrong with this plot?

# How does 2023 compare to 2022 so far?

.pull-left[
```{r ithaca-weather-plot3, fig.show="hide", fig.dim=c(4, 3), out.width="100%"}
# plot data
cornell_temps |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = day, 
             y = TMAX, 
             color = as_factor(year))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() +  #<<
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(x = "Day of month",  #<<
       y = "Max. daily temperature (F)",  #<<
       color = "Year") #<<
```

Two advantages of this approach are:
1. we have a script to **reproduce** our work / share our methods with others
2. we could **generalize** and **scale** this much more easily than manual work in excel (for example)
]

.pull-right[

# How does 2023 compare to 2022 so far?

For example we can **generalize** this approach to other weather outcomes:

.pull-left[
```{r ithaca-weather-plot4, fig.show="hide", fig.dim=c(4, 3), out.width="100%"}
# plot data
cornell_temps |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = day, 
             y = SNOW, #<<
             color = as_factor(year))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(x = "Day of month",
       y = "Snowfall (inches)", #<<
       color = "Year")
```
]

.pull-right[
  ![](`r knitr::fig_chunk("ithaca-weather-plot4", "png")`)
]

Note: NOAA publishes data with a slight lag so this does not reflect snow since last week

> 2. It is functional, as it constitutes an accurate depiction of the data, and it’s built in a way that lets people do meaningful operations based on it (seeing change in time).
> 
> 3. It is beautiful, in the sense of being attractive, intriguing, and even aesthetically pleasing for its intended audience—scientists, in the first place, but the general public, too.
