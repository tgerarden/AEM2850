# What sports do we watch?

Take a guess: what's the most popular spectator sport among classmates?

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(magrittr)
load("data/survey-responses/survey-data.RData")
```

--

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
sports
```

--

Let's `count` and `arrange` to get the top 3:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# now show off what we can do with summarize()
tibble::tibble(sport = sports) |> 
  dplyr::count(sport) |> 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(n)) |> 
  head(3)
```

---

# R can be used for sports analytics, too!

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03/stephen-curry.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03/kobe-bryant.png")
```
