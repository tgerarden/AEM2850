# Prologue

# What sports do we watch?

Take a guess: what's the most popular spectator sport among classmates?

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
load("data/survey-responses/survey-data.RData")
```

--

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
sports
```

--

Let's `count` and `arrange` to get the top 3:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# now show off what we can do with summarize()
tibble::tibble(sport = sports) |> 
  dplyr::count(sport) |> 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(n)) |> 
  head(3)
```

---

# R can be used for sports analytics, too!

# Relational data


---

# What are relational data?

--

Multiple tables of data with pairwise relations

Relations across >2 data tables are determined by the relations between each pair

---

# Relational data verbs from dplyr

1. **Mutating joins**: add new variables
  - `left_join()`
  - `right_join()`
  - `inner_join()`
  - `full_join()`

2. **Filtering joins**: filter observations
  - `semi_join()`
  - `anti_join()`


<!-- --- -->

<!-- # How do join verbs work? -->


<!-- From Ivan Rudik's slides: -->

<!-- We need two datasets (e.g., housing prices and pollution) -->

<!-- Each dataset has the same set of **key** variables (e.g. county) -->

<!-- When we join, we match up the two datasets on the key, and combine them into one -->

<!-- In our housing example, each row of the joined dataset would now tell us the house price, the county it's in, and the county's pollution -->

# Joins

Let's learn these join commands using two small data frames

```{r echo = FALSE}
superheroes <- tibble::tribble(
       ~name, ~alignment,  ~gender,          ~publisher,
   "Magneto",      "bad",   "male",            "Marvel",
     "Storm",     "good", "female",            "Marvel",
  "Mystique",      "bad", "female",            "Marvel",
    "Batman",     "good",   "male",                "DC",
     "Joker",      "bad",   "male",                "DC",
  "Catwoman",      "bad", "female",                "DC",
   "Hellboy",     "good",   "male", "Dark Horse Comics"
  )

publishers <- tibble::tribble(
  ~publisher, ~yr_founded,
        "DC",       1934L,
    "Marvel",       1939L,
     "Image",       1992L
  )
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
superheroes
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
publishers
```
]

# 1) dplyr::left_join(x, y)

```{r ljoin}
left_join(superheroes, publishers)
```

`left_join` is a **mutating join**: it adds variables to `x`

`left_join` returns all rows from `x`

---

# 2) dplyr::right_join(x, y)

```{r rjoin}
right_join(superheroes, publishers)
```

`right_join` is a **mutating join**: it adds variables to `y`

`right_join` returns all rows from `y`

---

# 3) dplyr::inner_join(x, y)

```{r ijoin}
inner_join(superheroes, publishers)
```

How is `inner_join` different from `left_join` and `right_join`?

--

`inner_join` returns all rows in `x` **AND** `y`

---

# 4) dplyr::full_join(x, y)

```{r fjoin, eval = FALSE}
full_join(superheroes, publishers) # how many rows will this produce?
```

--

```{r fjoinb, echo = FALSE}
full_join(superheroes, publishers)
```

`full_join` returns all rows in `x` **OR** `y`

---

# 5) dplyr::semi_join(x, y)

.pull-left[
```{r}
superheroes
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r sjoin}
semi_join(superheroes, publishers)
```
]

`semi_join` is a **filtering join**: it keeps observations in `x` that have a match in `y`

Note that the variables do not change

---

# 6) dplyr::anti_join(x, y)

.pull-left[
```{r}
superheroes
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ajoin}
anti_join(superheroes, publishers)
```
]

`anti_join` is a **filtering join**: it keeps obs. in `x` that **DO NOT** have a match in `y`

Note that the variables do not change


---

# Key variables

How do `dplyr` join commands know what variables to use as **keys**?

--

By default, `*_join()` uses all variables that are common across `x` and `y`
```{r}
intersect(names(superheroes), names(publishers)) # variable used for matching before
```

--

Alternatively, we can specify what to join `by`: `*_join(..., by = "publisher")`

---

# More on joins

Let's explore this using the [**nycflights13**](https://github.com/tidyverse/nycflights13) data

```{r flights}
library(nycflights13)
flights
```

---

# More on joins

```{r planes}
planes
```

---

# More on joins

Let's perform a left join on the flights and planes data frames
- I'm going subset columns after the join, just to keep text on the slide

--

```{r join1}
left_join(flights, planes) %>%
  select(year, month, day, dep_time, arr_time, carrier, flight, tailnum, type, model)
```

---

# More on joins

As before, `dplyr` guessed which columns to join on

It uses columns with the same name:

```
*## Joining, by = c("year", "tailnum")
```

Does anyone see a potential problem here?

--

The variable `year` does not have a consistent meaning across the datasets

--

In `flights` it refers to the *year of flight*, in `planes` it refers to *year of construction*

--

Luckily we can avoid this by using the `by =` argument

---

# More on joins

We just need to be more explicit in the join call by using the `by = ` argument

```{r join2, highlight.line = 4}
left_join(flights,
          planes %>% rename(year_built = year), # not necessary w/ below line, but helpful
          by = "tailnum" # be specific about the joining column #<< 
          ) %>%
  select(year, month, day, dep_time, arr_time, carrier, flight, tailnum, year_built, type, model) %>%
  head(5) # just to save vertical space on the slide
```

---

# More on joins

What happens if we don't rename `year` before this join?

```{r join2b, highlight.line = 4}
left_join(flights,
          planes, # not renaming "year" to "year_built" this time
          by = "tailnum") %>%
  select(contains("year"), month, day, dep_time, arr_time, carrier, flight, tailnum, type, model) %>%
  head(5) # just to save vertical space on the slide
```

--

What is `year.x`? What is `year.y`?
