# Prologue

# What are our concentrations?

Take a guess: what's the most common concentration among classmates?

--

```{r, echo = FALSE}
load("data/survey-responses/survey-data.RData")
as_tibble(concentrations_raw)
```

---

# What are our concentrations?

After some processing to get concentration counts, we get:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
concentrations %>% select(-response) %>% 
  summarize_all(sum, na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
   relocate(sort(tidyselect::peek_vars()))
```

What is the "level of observation" in this data frame? (i.e., what are the rows?)

--

Is the best way to organize concentration counts?

--

How would you use counts to compute shares in this data frame?

---

# What are our "tidy" concentrations?

Let's `pivot_longer` and `arrange` to get the top 3:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# now show off what we can do with pivot_longer()
concentrations %>% select(-response) %>% 
  summarize_all(sum, na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "concentration", values_to = "count") %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  head(3)
```

--

How would you use counts to compute shares in this data frame?

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tidy_concentrations %>% mutate(share = count / sum(count)) # easy!
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
concentrations %>% select(-response) %>% 
  summarize_all(sum, na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "concentration", values_to = "count") %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  mutate(share = count / sum(count)) %>% 
  head(3)
```

# Data import


---

# Data import

Plain-text rectangular files are a common way to store and share data:
- comma delimited files (`readr::read_csv`)
- tab delimited files (`readr::read_tsv`)
- fixed width files (`readr::read_fwf`)

We will just cover csv files since `readr` syntax is transferable

# Super bowl ads: a csv example

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/04/superbowl-ads.png")
```

# Super bowl ads in csv format

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/04/superbowl-raw.png")
```

# Super bowl ads in csv format

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/04/superbowl-excel.png")
```

---

# Getting from a csv to a data frame

How are data frames and csv files similar?

--
- both are rectangular
- csv lines often correspond to rows
- csv commas delineate columns

--

How are they different?

--
- csv files do not store column types!

---

# 1) readr::read_csv

`read_csv` helps us get from point a to point b:
- you give it the path to your csv file
- it takes the first line of data as column names by default
- it guesses column types and builds up a data frame

Most csv files can be read using the defaults, so we will focus on that

If you run into special cases, consult `?read_csv`

---

# 1) readr::read_csv

```{r read-ads}
ads <- read_csv("data/superbowl.csv")
```

--

That was easy!

---

# Now we're back to our old tricks

.pull-left[
```{r}
ads %>% 
  group_by(funny) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
ads %>% 
  group_by(brand) %>% 
  summarize(likes = sum(like_count, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(likes))
```
]

---

# 2) readr::write_csv

Use `write_csv` to write data to a `.csv`:

```{r write-ads, eval = FALSE}
write_csv(ads, "data/superbowl.csv") # overwrite the raw data (bad idea!)

ads %>% 
  select(year, brand, youtube_url) %>% 
  write_csv("superbowl-urls.csv") # write modified output to a new file
```

---

# csv is not always the best storage medium

To preserve column specifications and save time when working in R, use `write_rds()` and `read_rds()` to save and open data frames in .RDS format

For multiple objects, `save()` and `load()` are handy functions from base R that work with the .RData format

---

# Importing excel data

Wait, what about getting data from excel spreadsheets?

--

Use `readxl::read_excel()` for data that is stored in `.xls` or `.xlsx` format

`readxl` isn't loaded as part of the core tidyverse, so we need to load it first:

```{r readxl}
library(readxl)
excel_sheets("data/readxl/datasets.xlsx") # list the sheets in datasets.xlsx
```

---

# Importing excel data

```{r}
read_excel("data/readxl/datasets.xlsx", sheet = "mtcars")
```

---

# Importing excel data

Can also use arguments like `range` to get data using excel lingo

```{r}
read_excel("data/readxl/datasets.xlsx", 
           range = "mtcars!A1:D6") # note the combination of sheet and cell range
```

# Tidy data


---

# WHAT is "tidy" data?

---

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/04/tidydata_1.jpg")
```


---

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/04/tidydata_2.jpg")
```


---

# WHY "tidy" data?

---

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/04/tidydata_3.jpg")
```


---

# HOW can we "tidy" data?

**Key tidyr verbs**

1. `pivot_longer`: Pivot wide data into long format (updated version of `gather`) 

2. `pivot_wider`: Pivot long data into wide format (updated version of `spread`) 

3. `separate`: Split one column into multiple columns

4. `unite`: Combine multiple columns into one


---
name: pivot_longer

# 1) tidyr::pivot_longer

```{r pivot_longer1}
stocks <- data.frame( # could use "tibble" instead of "data.frame" if you prefer
  time = as.Date('2009-01-01') + 0:1,
  X = rnorm(2, 0, 1),
  Y = rnorm(2, 0, 2),
  Z = rnorm(2, 0, 4)
  )
stocks
```

We have 4 columns, the date and the stocks

How do we get this in tidy form?

---

# 1) tidyr::pivot_longer

We need to pivot the stock name columns `X`, `Y`, `Z` longer

1. Choose columns using `X:Z` or `-time`
2. Decide what variable holds the names: `names_to = "stock"`
3. Decide what variable holds the values: `values_to = "price"`

---

# 1) tidyr::pivot_longer

```{r pivot_longer1b}
stocks %>% pivot_longer(X:Z, names_to = "stock", values_to = "price")
```

--

Let's save the "tidy" (i.e., long) stocks data frame for use on the next slide

```{r pivot_longer2}
tidy_stocks <- stocks %>% 
  pivot_longer(-time, names_to = "stock", values_to = "price")
```

---
name: pivot_wider

# 2) tidyr::pivot_wider

```{r pivot_wider1, dependson=tidy_stocks}
tidy_stocks %>% pivot_wider(names_from = stock, values_from = price)
tidy_stocks %>% pivot_wider(names_from = time, values_from = price)
```

--

Note that the second example effectively transposed the original data

---
name: separate

# 3) tidyr::separate

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# economists <- data.frame(name = c("Adam.Smith", "Paul.Samuelson", "Milton.Friedman"))
```

```{r sep1}
halftime_openers <- data.frame(name = c("Dr.Dre", "Snoop.Dogg"))
halftime_openers
```

--

```{r sep1a}
halftime_openers %>% separate(name, c("first_name", "last_name")) 
```

--

This command is pretty smart. But to avoid ambiguity, you can also specify the separation character with `separate(..., sep=".")`

---

# 3) tidyr::separate

```{r sep1b}
halftime_performers <- data.frame(name = c("Dr..Dre", "Snoop.Dogg", "Eminem", "Mary.J.Blige",
                                           "Kendrick.Lamar", "50.Cent", "Anderson..Paak"))
```
--
```{r sep1c}
halftime_performers %>% separate(name, c("first_name", "last_name"))
```

What happened? Did we lose any information?

???
No "Blige", no . in "Dr." or ".Paak"

---
name: unite

# 4) tidyr::unite

```{r unite1}
gdp <- data.frame(
  yr = rep(2016, times = 4),
  mnth = rep(1, times = 4),
  dy = 1:4,
  gdp = rnorm(4, mean = 100, sd = 2)
  )
gdp 
```

---

# 4) tidyr::unite

```{r unite1b}
# combine "yr", "mnth", and "dy" into one "date" column
gdp %>% unite(date, c("yr", "mnth", "dy"), sep = "-")
```

---

# 4) tidyr::unite

Note that `unite` will automatically create a character variable:
```{r unite2, highlight.lines = 3}
gdp_u <- gdp %>% unite(date, c("yr", "mnth", "dy"), sep = "-") %>% as_tibble()
gdp_u
```

--

To convert it to something else (e.g., date or numeric), modify it using `mutate`

---

# 4) tidyr::unite

```{r unite3, message=F}
library(lubridate) # the lubridate package has helpful date conversion functions
gdp_u %>% mutate(date = ymd(date))
```

# Relational data


---

# What are relational data?

--

Multiple tables of data with pairwise relations

Relations across >2 data tables are determined by the relations between each pair

---

# Relational data verbs from dplyr

1. **Mutating joins**: add new variables
  - `inner_join()`
  - `left_join()`
  - `right_join()`
  - `full_join()`

2. **Filtering joins**: filter observations
  - `semi_join()`
  - `anti_join()`


<!-- --- -->

<!-- # How do join verbs work? -->


<!-- From Ivan Rudik's slides: -->

<!-- We need two datasets (e.g., housing prices and pollution) -->

<!-- Each dataset has the same set of **key** variables (e.g. county) -->

<!-- When we join, we match up the two datasets on the key, and combine them into one -->

<!-- In our housing example, each row of the joined dataset would now tell us the house price, the county it's in, and the county's pollution -->

# Data: flights

Let's use the data that comes with the [**nycflights13**](http://github.com/hadley/nycflights13) package

```{r flights}
library(nycflights13)
flights
```

---

# Data: planes

```{r planes}
planes
```

---

# Joins

Let's perform a left join on the flights and planes data frames
- I'm going subset columns after the join, but only to keep text on the slide

--

```{r join1}
left_join(flights, planes) %>%
  select(year, month, day, dep_time, arr_time, carrier, flight, tailnum, type, model)
```

---

# Joins

`dplyr` guessed which columns to join on, using columns with the same name:

```
*## Joining, by = c("year", "tailnum")
```

There's a problem here: the variable `year` does not have a consistent meaning across our joining datasets

--

In `flights` it refers to the *year of flight*, in `planes` it refers to *year of construction*

--

Luckily, there's an easy way to avoid this problem. How?
<!-- - See if you can figure it out before turning to the next slide. -->
- Start with `?dplyr::join`

---

# Joins

We just need to be more explicit in the join call by using the `by = ` argument

```{r join2, highlight.line = 4}
left_join(flights,
          planes %>% rename(year_built = year), # not necessary w/ below line, but helpful
          by = "tailnum" # be specific about the joining column #<< 
          ) %>%
  select(year, month, day, dep_time, arr_time, carrier, flight, tailnum, year_built, type, model) %>%
  head(5) # just to save vertical space on the slide
```

---

# Joins

What happens if we don't rename `year` before this join?

```{r join2b, highlight.line = 4}
left_join(flights,
          planes, # not renaming "year" to "year_built" this time
          by = "tailnum") %>%
  select(contains("year"), month, day, dep_time, arr_time, carrier, flight, tailnum, type, model) %>%
  head(5) # just to save vertical space on the slide
```

--

What is `year.x`? What is `year.y`?

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Mutating joins -->

<!-- 1. `inner_join` -->
<!-- 2. `left_join` -->
<!-- 3. `right_join` -->
<!-- 4. `full_join` -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- # Filtering joins -->

<!-- 1. `semi_join` -->
