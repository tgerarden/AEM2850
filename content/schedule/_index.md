Hereâ€™s your roadmap for the semester! *Note:* this will inevitably change throughout the semester as we develop the course together. Please visit this page regularly throughout the semester.

### Overview

The class is structured with three distinct bits. On Tuesday I will provide an overview of the topic for the week. On Thursday we will work through a hands-on example to gain programming experience. Finally, each week outside of class you will complete readings, reflections, and labs (and other assignments later in the semester).

- [**Content**](/content/) (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): This page contains readings, guiding questions, and lecture slides for each topic.

- [**Examples**](/example/) (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>): This page contains the material that we will cover in Thursday classes.

- [**Assignments**](/assignment/) (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>): This page contains the instructions for completing assignments.

<!-- ### Office hours reminder: -->

<!-- I highly encourage you to utilize Professor and TA office hours, especially if you have trouble with basic `R` programming. We will hold office hours at the following times: -->

<!-- #<!-- - Mondays 12:20pm - 1:20pm: TA Sophie McComb in Warren 372 -->
<!-- - Mondays  1:30pm - 3:30pm: TA Hui Zhou in Warren 372 -->
<!-- - Tuesdays 11:00am - 12:00pm: Prof. Gerarden in Warren 466 -->
<!-- - Fridays  10:00am - 11:00am: TA Sophie McComb in Warren 372 -->
<!-- - Other times by appointment: Prof. Gerarden, at [aem2850.youcanbook.me](https://aem2850.youcanbook.me) -->

<!-- You can also reach us by email. The best approach for generic, time-sensitive questions is to email all of us at the same time. You can do that with one click [here](mailto:gerarden@cornell.edu,hz423@cornell.edu,sm2397@cornell.edu). -->



<!-- :::note -->
### **tl;dr:**

You should follow this general process each week:

- Do readings listed on the content page before Tuesday
- Tuesday: come to class
<!-- - Wednesday: submit reflection on canvas by 11:59pm (starting with Week 2) -->
- Thursday: come to class, where we will work through examples
- Work on the lab before the next Tuesday's class, attending [office hours](/syllabus/#meeting-times-and-locations) as needed
- Monday: submit lab on canvas by 11:59pm
