Hereâ€™s your roadmap for the semester! *Note:* this will inevitably change throughout the semester as we develop the course together. Please visit this page regularly throughout the semester.

### Overview

The class is structured with three distinct bits. On Tuesday I will provide an overview of the topic for the week. On Thursday I will give a short, practical lecture and an activity which is designed to give you hands-on experience and a greater understanding of the broader material. Finally, each week outside of class you will complete readings, reflections, and labs (and other assignments later in the semester).

- [**Content**](/content/) (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): This page contains readings, guiding questions, and lecture slides for each topic.

- [**Examples**](/example/) (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>): This page contains the material that we will discuss in Thursday classes.

- [**Assignments**](/assignments/) (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>): This page contains the instructions for the weekly labs and for the two mini projects + final project.

### Office hours reminder:

I highly encourage you to utilize Professor and TA office hours, especially if you have trouble with basic `R` programming. We will hold office hours at the following times:

- Mondays  1:30pm - 3:30pm: TA Hui Zhou at [cornell.zoom.us/j/4786955504](https://cornell.zoom.us/j/4786955504?pwd=VitTc1hVSjJSVXovWGJlRG9VQm5TZz09)
- Tuesdays 11:00am - 12:00pm: Prof. Gerarden using [the class zoom link](https://cornell.zoom.us/j/98464434953?pwd=VDJuR0RhckttSTBJVVBqUXhDT3FxUT09)
- Other times by appointment: Prof. Gerarden, at [aem2850.youcanbook.me](https://aem2850.youcanbook.me)

You can also reach us by email. The best approach is to email both of us at the same time. You can do that with one click [here](mailto:gerarden@cornell.edu,hz423@cornell.edu).



<!-- :::note -->
### **tl;dr:**

You should follow this general process each week:

- Do readings listed on the content page before Tuesday
- Tuesday: come to class
- Wednedsday: submit reflection on canvas by 11:59pm (starting with Week 2)
- Thursday: come to class, where we will work through examples
- Work on the lab before the next Tuesday's class, attending office hours as needed
- Monday: submit lab on canvas by 11:59pm
