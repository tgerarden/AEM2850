Hereâ€™s your roadmap for the semester! *Note:* this will inevitably change throughout the semester as we develop the course together. Please visit this page regularly throughout the semester.

### Overview

The class is structured with three distinct bits. On Tuesday I will provide an overview of the topic for the week. On Thursday we will work through a hands-on example to gain programming experience. Finally, each week outside of class you will complete readings and homework assignments (and other assignments later in the semester).

- [**Content**](/content/) (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): This page contains readings, guiding questions, and lecture slides for each topic.

- [**Examples**](/example/) (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>): This page contains the material that we will cover in Thursday classes.

- [**Assignments**](/assignment/) (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>): This page contains the instructions for completing assignments.

<!-- :::note -->
### **tl;dr:**

You should follow this general process each week:

- Do readings listed on the content page before Tuesday
- Tuesday: come to class
- Thursday: come to class, where we will work through examples
- Work on the lab before the next Tuesday's class, attending [office hours](/syllabus/#meeting-times-and-locations) as needed
- Monday: submit lab on canvas by 11:59pm
