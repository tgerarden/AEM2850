<p>Here’s your roadmap for the semester! <em>Note:</em> this will inevitably change throughout the semester as we develop the course together. Please visit this page regularly throughout the semester.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The class is structured with three distinct bits. On Tuesday I will provide an overview of the topic for the week. On Thursday we will work through a hands-on example to gain programming experience. Finally, each week outside of class you will complete readings, reflections, and labs (and other assignments later in the semester).</p>

<!-- ### Office hours reminder: -->
<!-- I highly encourage you to utilize Professor and TA office hours, especially if you have trouble with basic `R` programming. We will hold office hours at the following times: -->
<!-- #<!-- - Mondays 12:20pm - 1:20pm: TA Sophie McComb in Warren 372 -->
<!-- - Mondays  1:30pm - 3:30pm: TA Hui Zhou in Warren 372 -->
<!-- - Tuesdays 11:00am - 12:00pm: Prof. Gerarden in Warren 466 -->
<!-- - Fridays  10:00am - 11:00am: TA Sophie McComb in Warren 372 -->
<!-- - Other times by appointment: Prof. Gerarden, at [aem2850.youcanbook.me](https://aem2850.youcanbook.me) -->
<!-- You can also reach us by email. The best approach for generic, time-sensitive questions is to email all of us at the same time. You can do that with one click [here](mailto:gerarden@cornell.edu,hz423@cornell.edu,sm2397@cornell.edu). -->
