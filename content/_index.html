<p>Each class session has a set of required readings that you should ideally complete <strong><em>before</em></strong> coming to lecture and working through the examples for each topic.</p>
<p>Each topic includes a set of questions to help guide your reflection response. You do not need to respond to all of them—they’ll just help you know what to look for and think about as you read.</p>
<p>The lecture slides are special HTML files made with the R package <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html"><strong>xaringan</strong></a> (R can do so much!). On each class session page you’ll buttons for opening the presentation in a new tab or for downloading a PDF of the slides in case you want to print them or store them on your computer:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<span class="btn btn-primary btn-lg"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> View all slides in new window</span> <span class="btn btn-primary btn-lg"><i class="far fa-file-pdf"></i> Download PDF of all slides</span>
</p>
<p>The slides are also embedded on each page. You can click in the slides and navigate through them with <kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd>. If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while viewing the slides you can see a list of slide-specific commands (like <kbd>f</kbd> for fullscreen or <kbd>p</kbd> for presenter mode if you want to see my notes).</p>
