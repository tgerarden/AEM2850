There are a ton of places to find data related to business online. Here are some examples:

- [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets): Kaggle hosts machine learning competitions. A byproduct of these competitions is a host of fascinating datasets that are generally free and open to the public. The datasets are sometimes accompanied with suggestions for how to analyze them. Here are a few examples:
  - [Chase Bank Branch Deposits, 2010â€“2016](https://www.kaggle.com/chasebank/bank-deposits): Records for every branch of Chase Bank in the United States. This dataset is not quite tidy and will require a little bit of reshaping with `gather()` or `pivot_longer()`, since there are individual columns of deposits per year.
  - [Credit Card Approvals](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction): a credit card dataset for prediction methods.
  - [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud): anonymous credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or genuine.
  - [515K Hotel Reviews Data in Europe](https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe): 515,000 customer reviews and scoring of 1,493 luxury hotels across Europe.
  - [Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)

- [**Yahoo Finance**](https://finance.yahoo.com)
  - There are many ways to access data from Yahoo Finance. One option is to scrape data. Another is to use a package like `tidyquant` to `tq_get()` quantative data in a tibble format. This package can also be used to get data from FRED, Quandl, and other sources.

- [**Twitter**](http://www.twitter.com): You could collect data on tweets that reference a specific company via [the twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/getting-started-with-r-and-v2-of-the-twitter-api) or by using a package like [`twitteR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/index.html) to access the API. Then you could use this on its own or in conjunction with some other data (e.g., stock prices/returns) to do an analysis of consumer sentiment, for example.

- [**Inside Airbnb**](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/): Inside Airbnb is a mission-driven activist project with the objective to provide data that quantifies the impact of short-term rentals on housing and residential communities, as well as create a platform to support advocacy for policies to protect our cities from the impacts of short-term rentals.
