<p>This section contains the content covered on Thursdays, including links to <code>R</code> code that you can use as a reference for creating your own work. In the Content section, you sequentially build up your understanding of <code>R</code> programming; here you can see how all the pieces work together.</p>
<p>Examples contain material we will discuss and use to learn <code>R</code> in class. These notes are <em>not</em> comprehensive. Instead, they are meant as a helpful resource during and after class in case you are confused or have trouble remembering something we discussed.</p>
