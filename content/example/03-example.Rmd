## RStudio Cloud links

[Click here to access this week's Example RStudio Cloud Project](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/210747/project/3569822)

[**Solutions:** click here to access a project with a completed version](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/210747/project/3569863)


## Plan for today
- Questions? :raising_hand_woman:
- Wrap up slides from Tuesday (`dplyr::summarize`)
- Work through `intro-tidyverse-practice.R`:
  - We will revisit data from [this FiveThirtyEight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/)
  - On our own devices: 1. Getting Comfortable with Data Frames
  - As a group: discuss results, answer questions
  - On our own devices: 2. Using Functions in Packages


## tidyverse version

**Note:** If you are working locally, make sure you are running at least **dplyr** 1.0.0:

```{r dplyr_vers}
# packageVersion('dplyr')
# install.packages('dplyr') # install updated version if < 1.0.0
```


## Cheatsheets
