This section contains the content covered on Thursdays, including links to `R` code that you can use as a reference for creating your own work. In the Content section, you sequentially build up your understanding of `R` programming; here you can see how all the pieces work together.

Examples contain material we will discuss and use to learn `R` in class. These notes are *not* comprehensive. Instead, they are meant as a helpful resource during and after class in case you are confused or have trouble remembering something we discussed.
