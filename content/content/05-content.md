<!-- #### Optional readings -->


<!-- #### Other resources -->

<!-- [This tutorial by CÃ©dric Scherer](https://www.cedricscherer.com/2019/05/17/the-evolution-of-a-ggplot-ep.-1/) is an excellent demonstration of the grammar of graphics and the sequential nature of building up a plot layer-by-layer. -->


### Guiding questions

- Why is it important to visualize variables and data?
- What does it mean to map data to graph aesthetics?
- What data was mapped to which aesthetics in Rosling's video?
