<h3>Readings</h3>
<p>Each week we will have a set of readings that you should ideally complete <strong><em>before</em></strong> coming to lecture and working through the examples and labs for each topic.</p>

<h3>Guiding questions</h3>
<p>Each topic includes a set of questions to help guide your reflection response. You do not need to respond to all of them—they’re just intended to help guide your thinking.</p>
</div>
<div id="slides" class="section level3">
<h3>Slides</h3>
<p>The lecture slides are HTML files made with the R package <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html"><strong>xaringan</strong></a>. On each class session page you’ll buttons for opening the presentation in a new browser tab or for downloading a PDF of the slides in case you want to print them or store them on your computer:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<span class="btn btn-primary btn-lg"><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> View all slides in new window</span> <span class="btn btn-primary btn-lg"><i class="far fa-file-pdf"></i> Download PDF of all slides</span>
</p>
<p>If you open the HTML version, you can navigate through them with arrows: <kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd>. If you type <kbd>?</kbd> while viewing the slides you can see a list of slide-specific commands (e.g., <kbd>f</kbd> for fullscreen, or <kbd>o</kbd> to view all the slides at once).</p>
