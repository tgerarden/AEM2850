<p>Here’s your roadmap for the semester! <em>Note:</em> this will inevitably change throughout the semester as we develop the course together. Please visit this page regularly throughout the semester.</p>
<div id="overview" class="section level3">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The class is structured with three distinct bits. First, the Tuesday lecture will give an overview of the topic for the week. Next, the Thursday lecture will have a short, practical lecture and an activity which is designed to give you hands-on experience and a greater understanding of the broader material. Finally, you will complete weekly writings (short) and labs (also short; requiring coding in <code>R</code>). Out of class, you will complete readings and complete assignments.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="/content/"><strong>Content</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): This page contains the readings for the topic. These pages should be read completely. Lectures are <em>not</em> an exact replication of the written content; on the contrary, the lectures are intended to keep you focused on the high-level ideas, while the readings are broader and more comprehensive. Accordingly, lectures are shorter than the (often quite lengthy) written content.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/example/"><strong>Examples</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>): This page the material that we will discuss in Thursday classes. In addition to teaching specific content, there are many more <code>R</code> code examples. These are intended as a useful reference to various functions that you will need when working on (nearly) weekly labs and your group project.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/assignment/"><strong>Assignments</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>): This page contains the instructions for the weekly lab (1–3 brief tasks) and for the two mini projects + final project. <strong>Labs are due by 11:59 PM (Eastern) on the Monday after they’re posted.</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<div id="office-hours-reminder" class="section level3">
<h3>Office hours reminder:</h3>
<p>I highly encourage you to utilize Professor and TA office hours, especially if you struggle with basic <code>R</code> programming.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mondays 2pm - 4pm: TA Hui Zhou at <a href="https://cornell.zoom.us/j/4786955504?pwd=VitTc1hVSjJSVXovWGJlRG9VQm5TZz09">cornell.zoom.us/j/4786955504</a></li>
<li>Tuesdays 11am - 12pm: Prof. Gerarden using <a href="https://cornell.zoom.us/j/98464434953?pwd=VDJuR0RhckttSTBJVVBqUXhDT3FxUT09">the class zoom link</a></li>
<li>Other times by appointment: Prof. Gerarden, at <a href="https://aem2850.youcanbook.me">aem2850.youcanbook.me</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also reach us by email. The best approach is to email both of us at the same time. You can do that with one click <a href="mailto:gerarden@cornell.edu,hz423@cornell.edu">here</a>.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: You should follow this general process (in order) each week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do everything on the content page before Tuesday (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>)</li>
<li>Come to lecture on Tuesday</li>
<li>In class on Thursday, we will work through the example page (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>)</li>
<li>Complete the lab (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>) and the weekly writing (assigned in class) before the next Tuesday’s class.</li>
<li>As needed, attend the lab hours hosted by the TA.</li>
</ul>
