<p>Here’s your roadmap for the semester! <em>Note:</em> this will inevitably change throughout the semester as we develop the course together. Please visit this page regularly throughout the semester.</p>
<div id="overview" class="section level3">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The class is structured with three distinct bits. On Tuesday I will provide an overview of the topic for the week. On Thursday we will work through a hands-on example to gain programming experience. Finally, each week outside of class you will complete readings and labs (and other assignments later in the semester).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="/content/"><strong>Content</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): This page contains readings, guiding questions, and lecture slides for each topic.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/example/"><strong>Examples</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>): This page contains the material that we will cover in Thursday classes.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/assignment/"><strong>Assignments</strong></a> (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>): This page contains the instructions for completing assignments.</p></li>

<p>You should follow this general process each week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do readings listed on the content page before Tuesday</li>
<li>Tuesday: come to class</li>
<li>Thursday: come to class, where we will work through examples</li>
<li>Work on the lab before the next Tuesday’s class, attending <a href="/syllabus/#meeting-times-and-locations">office hours</a> as needed</li>
<li>Monday: submit lab on canvas by 11:59pm
