<p>Here’s your roadmap for the semester! <em>Note:</em> this will inevitably change throughout the semester as we develop the course together. Please visit this page regularly throughout the semester.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The class is structured with three distinct bits. On Tuesday I will provide an overview of the topic for the week. On Thursday I will give a short, practical lecture and an activity which is designed to give you hands-on experience and a greater understanding of the broader material. Finally, each week outside of class you will complete readings, reflections, and labs (and other assignments later in the semester).</p>

<h3>Office hours reminder:</h3>
<p>I highly encourage you to utilize Professor and TA office hours, especially if you have trouble with basic <code>R</code> programming. We will hold office hours at the following times:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mondays 12:20pm - 1:20pm: TA Sophie McComb in Warren 372</li>
<li>Mondays 1:30pm - 3:30pm: TA Hui Zhou in Warren 372</li>
<li>Tuesdays 11:00am - 12:00pm: Prof. Gerarden in Warren 466</li>
<li>Fridays 10:00am - 11:00am: TA Sophie McComb in Warren 372</li>
<li>Other times by appointment: Prof. Gerarden, at <a href="https://aem2850.youcanbook.me">aem2850.youcanbook.me</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also reach us by email. The best approach for generic, time-sensitive questions is to email all of us at the same time. You can do that with one click <a href="mailto:gerarden@cornell.edu,hz423@cornell.edu,sm2397@cornell.edu">here</a>.</p>
